SYNOPSIS

     use IPC::System::Options qw(system);
    
     # use exactly like system()
     system(...);
    
     # but it accepts an optional hash first argument to specify options
     system({...}, ...);
    
     # run without shell, even though there is only one argument
     system({shell=>0}, "ls");
     system({shell=>0}, "ls -lR"); # will fail, as there is no 'ls -lR' binary
    
     # set LC_ALL/LANGUAGE/LANG environment variable
     system({lang=>"de_DE.UTF-8"}, "df");

DESCRIPTION

FUNCTIONS

 system([ \%opts ], @args)

    Just like perl's system() except that it accepts an optional hash first
    argument to specify options. Currently known options:

      * shell => bool

      Can be set to 0 to always avoid invoking the shell. The default is to
      use the shell under certain conditions, like Perl's system().

      * lang => str

      Set locale-related environment variables: LC_ALL (this is the highest
      precedence, even higher than the other LC_* variables including
      LC_MESSAGES), LANGUAGE (this is used in Linux, with precedence higher
      than LANG but lower than LC_*), and LANG.

      Of course you can set the environment variables manually, this option
      is just for convenience.

 backtick([ \%opts ], @args)

    Just like perl's backtick operator (qx()) except that it accepts an
    optional hash first argument to specify options.

    Known options:

      * lang => str

      See option documentation in system().
